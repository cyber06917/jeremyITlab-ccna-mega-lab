# Jeremy’s CCNA Mega Practical Lab – Configuration Files

This repository contains all the configuration files I created while working through **Jeremy’s IT Lab Mega CCNA Practical Lab**.

The lab covers almost all major ccna networking concepts and topologies, including:

- VLANs
- Trunking
- Routing (Static & Dynamic)
- EtherChannel
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- And more...

I completed each scenario step-by-step, building and testing configurations in line with CCNA-level best practices.

These files can be useful for:

- **Reference** while studying
- **Revision** before exams
- Anyone wanting to **follow along** with the same lab setup
