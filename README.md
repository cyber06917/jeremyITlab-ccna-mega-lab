# Jeremy’s CCNA Mega Practical Lab — Configuration Files

These are the configuration files I created while working through **Jeremy’s IT Lab Mega CCNA Practical Lab** for hands-on practice. I did not develop or author the lab content — all credit belongs to Jeremy’s IT Lab.

This practice covered almost all of CCNA topics that is :
- VLANs & trunking
- Static & dynamic routing
- EtherChannel
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- and more...
